A callback function in React is a function that is passed as a prop to a component, and is then executed by the component at a later time. This allows components to communicate with each other and share information. For example, a parent component may pass a callback function to a child component, and the child component can then call the function when a certain event occurs. The callback function can then be used to update the state of the parent component, or perform some other action.
