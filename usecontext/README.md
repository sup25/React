useContext is a Hook in React that allows a component to access a context, which is a way to share state and props between components without having to pass them down through multiple levels of the component tree.

It allows a component to subscribe to a context and receive updates whenever the context's state changes. This can be useful for sharing global state, such as user authentication or theme settings, across the entire app.

To use useContext, you first need to create a context using the createContext function. Then, you can use the useContext Hook in any component that needs to access the context, and pass in the created context as an argument.
